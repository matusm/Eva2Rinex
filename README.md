Eva2Rinex - A File Converter
======================

A standalone command line tool to convert proprietary metrological data files files to RINEX meteo format as required by the BIPM.

## Command Line Usage:

```
Eva2Rinex YYYYMMDD
```

## How it works

The tool takes two files with meterological data and converts the data to RINEX meteo format. The first and mandatory file is generated by the EVA 700 weather station by [Kroneis](http://www.kroneis.at) and deployed in a fixed directory. This file includes many parameters of which only the air temperature, the relative humidity and the air pressure are used. The weather station is located on the roof near the GPS antenna. 

The second station is located indoor, in the lab for the atomic clocks. It is a HMT 331 by [Vaisala](http://www.vaisala.com) for the measurement of lab air temperature and humidity, respectively. The data from this sensor is written to a different textfile by an pyhton application.

### File name convention

The name of the EVA file must match the pattern `YYYYMMDD.TXT` where the letters represent the year, month and day, respectively. The Vaisala file name must be of the form `Vaisala_Data_YYYYMMDD.txt`. Note: the file names (including extensions) are case sensitive on Linux system by default!

The name of the result file is more complicated, but well defined in the RINEX and BIPM documentations. An example from the BEV can look like `metBE59.126`.

### Configuration

The configuration file `Eva2Rinex.exe.config` (XML format) can be modified with an editor of your choice. The most important parameters are the directories of the input and output files, respectively.

### Caveats

In the current state this program is highly specialized for the use of the time and frequency division of the [BEV](http://www.bev.gv.at). The agency details (acronym, location, used instruments, ...) are hard coded, mainly in `SensorMetaData.SetBevSpecificMetaData(RinexType)`.

The time stamps for the output data are determined by the respective EVA input file. The nearest data lines are selected (if present) in the Vaisala input file.

The firmware of the EVA 700 was updated around August 2020. Older files can no longer be parsed correctly.
